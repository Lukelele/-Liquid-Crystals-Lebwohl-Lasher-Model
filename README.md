Accelerating Python: Lebwohl-Lasher-Model
---------------
Code for accelerating the Lebwohl-Lasher Monte-Carlo simulations in Python, this repository includes the following implementations: base Python, Numpy, Numba, Cython, C++, base Python with MPI, Numba with MPI, Cython with MPI, and Cython with OpenMP


All source code is located under the folder src, 3 Cython implementations are placed within folders, which contain the Cython .pyx file, setup file and run file
Analysis jupyter notebooks are located under the log folder, where you will also find the data generated for the plots
All of the code was produced and tested on a Windows machine, .bat files were used to generate data for analysis
